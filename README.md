# Legend UI

Legend UI is a set of React components themed with League of Legends for building data visualizations.

### Background

I wrote a Vue component library [league-ui](https://github.com/yingjieweb/league-ui) before, but I think it's not
good enough. So I decided to rewrite it with React. 🤔

### Current Status

This project is in the design and incubation stage, if you are also interested, welcome to join. 🤓️
